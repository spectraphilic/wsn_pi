- Make only one process to write to the USB device. Move writing from
  wsn_raw_cook to wsn_xbee

- Add unit tests, documentation, review.

- Upload files to the server in batches, maybe through RabbitMQ, so the files
  are stored in the server's filesystem, not just in the database.

- We use https://pypi.org/project/XBee/ ; consider using the new and official
  https://pypi.org/project/digi-xbee/
