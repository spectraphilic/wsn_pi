LoRa:

- Send acks to frames

- Use waspmote pkg format for Riot as well, for compatibility

Other:

- Finish the control cli, so we can reconfigure the remote motes from the Pi.

- Add unit tests, documentation, review.

- Upload files to the server in batches, maybe through RabbitMQ, so the files
  are stored in the server's filesystem, not just in the database.
